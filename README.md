# Simple Infection Simulation
Pygame draws an n by n matrix of rectangles. Each individual cell can be infected by infected neighbours, disinfected cells have a chance to heal neighbouring infected cells. Tweaking the code yield different patterns.

## Requirements
* Python
* Pygame

## Getting Started
When both Python and pygame are installed, just run ~~`run.py`~~ `main.py`.

## How does it work?
* WIP
